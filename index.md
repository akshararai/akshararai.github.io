# Akshara Rai

I am a research scientist at [Meta AI][Meta AI] in Menlo Park, working on robot learning. My research focuses on sample-efficient learning in robotics, through the use of prior knowledge from simulators, domain expertise. and optimal control. One of my greatest joys is to see my robots do something they couldn't do before (which is a lot of things). Here are some of the robots I have worked with.
